# Customer Support Assistant

## Overview
The **Customer Support Assistant** is a chatbot designed for the **Kea School of Government (KSG)**.  
It classifies customer queries, analyzes sentiment, and provides relevant responses.  
The system is built using **Gradio** and **LangGraph**, and it leverages the **OpenAI API** to generate intelligent replies.  
If a query carries negative sentiment, the assistant escalates it to a human agent for further handling.
